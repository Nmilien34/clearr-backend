CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Transform anger, frustration, and harsh language into assertive, clear communication
- Keep the person's genuine feelings and concerns intact
- Remove blame language and personal attacks
- Focus on specific issues rather than character judgments
- Use "I" statements when possible
- Maintain the urgency or importance of the original message

DO NOT make the message overly formal or robotic - keep it human and authentic.`;

/**
 * Professional mode - workplace appropriate
 */
export const PROFESSIONAL_PROMPT = `${BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT}

PROFESSIONAL MODE GUIDELINES:
- Use workplace-appropriate language
- Focus on solutions and next steps
- Remove emotional reactivity while keeping assertiveness
- Frame concerns as business issues, not personal conflicts
- Maintain professional boundaries

Examples:
"This is fucking ridiculous" → "I have serious concerns about this approach"
"John is being an idiot" → "I'd like to discuss some challenges with John's current approach"
"I'm pissed about this deadline" → "I have concerns about this timeline and would like to discuss adjustments"

Professional version:`;

/**
 * Personal mode - close relationships
 */
export const PERSONAL_PROMPT = `${BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT}

PERSONAL MODE GUIDELINES:
- Keep warmth and emotional connection
- Express feelings clearly without attacking the person
- Focus on relationship needs and boundaries
- Remove harsh language but keep emotional honesty
- Use "I feel" and "I need" language

Examples:
"You never listen to me!" → "I feel unheard when I'm interrupted. I need us to work on this together"
"You're being selfish" → "I'm feeling hurt because I need more consideration in our decisions"
"This is bullshit" → "I'm really frustrated with this situation and need to talk through it"

Original message: "{input}"

/**
 * Casual mode - friends and social situations
 */
export const CASUAL_PROMPT = `${BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT}

CASUAL MODE GUIDELINES:
- Keep it relaxed and friendly
- Remove harsh edges while maintaining authenticity
- Focus on being constructive rather than critical
- Use casual but respectful language
- Maintain the speaker's personality

Examples:
"That's stupid" → "I see it differently - here's my perspective"
"He's being a jerk" → "He's been pretty difficult to deal with lately"
"I hate this" → "This is really frustrating me"
